# 🎓 Academic Risk & Retention Analysis (Synthetic Case Study)

This project simulates a real-world institutional analysis using anonymized synthetic data. It explores how academic warning frequency impacts GPA trajectories and student retention outcomes, based on patterns observed in real retention programs.

---

## Project Overview

- Analyzed GPA trends and academic warnings across 1,000+ fictional student records
- Identified the correlation between warning count and GPA/retention outcomes
- Modeled GPA impact using regression
- Visualized GPA recovery paths and warning effects

---

## Real-World Context

This notebook is modeled after a confidential academic analytics project aimed at helping institutions identify at-risk students early and intervene more effectively.

**All data here is fictional** and generated to reflect realistic distributions seen in real academic environments.

---

## Key Features

- **Regression analysis** of warning count vs GPA
- **Boxplots & violin plots** for distributional insights
- **Graduation probability visualizations** by risk level
- **Python stack**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels

---

## Files

- `Academic_Risk_Retention_Analysis.ipynb`: Full notebook with analysis and visualizations
- `mock_academic_warning_data.csv`: Synthetic student data

---

## Tools Used

- Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Regression: statsmodels
- Visualization: violin plots, box plots, bar charts

---

## Note

This project is inspired by a confidential client engagement and re-constructed using synthetic data for educational purposes.
