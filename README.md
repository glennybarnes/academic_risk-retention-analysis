# üéì Academic Risk & Recovery Analysis (Synthetic Case Study)

This project mirrors a real-world academic analytics initiative focused on improving retention through early intervention. It explores the relationship between GPA trends, academic warnings, and graduation outcomes using anonymized or synthetic data.

## üîç Key Insights
- Regression: Each academic warning correlates with a 0.27 GPA drop (Term GPA).
- 50% of students with low GPAs recover by Term 2 if supported early.
- Students with 5+ warnings need 3x longer to stabilize GPAs.
- Programs like Business Admin saw faster recoveries.

## Techniques Used
- Descriptive statistics, regression models, violin/box plots
- Time-to-recovery analysis
- Feature importance using Random Forests
- Tools: Python, Power BI

## Note
All data shown here is fictional and was generated for educational and illustrative purposes. This project is inspired by real insights delivered in a confidential institutional study.
