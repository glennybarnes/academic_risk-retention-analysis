# 🎓 Academic Risk & Retention Analysis (Synthetic Case Study)

This project simulates a real-world institutional analysis using anonymized synthetic data. It explores how academic warning frequency impacts GPA trajectories and student retention outcomes, based on patterns observed in real retention programs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Analyzed GPA trends and academic warnings across 1,000+ fictional student records
- Identified the correlation between warning count and GPA/retention outcomes
- Modeled GPA impact using regression
- Visualized GPA recovery paths and warning effects

---

## 💼 Real-World Context

This notebook is modeled after a confidential academic analytics project aimed at helping institutions identify at-risk students early and intervene more effectively.

**All data here is fictional** and generated to reflect realistic distributions seen in real academic environments.

---

## 📈 Key Features

- **Regression analysis** of warning count vs GPA
- **Boxplots & violin plots** for distributional insights
- **Graduation probability visualizations** by risk level
- **Python stack**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels
